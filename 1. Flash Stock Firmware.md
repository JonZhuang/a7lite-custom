Ok, let's get rolling. It's actually super easy to get a custom GSI on your samsung phone - it's just overcomplicated in the explainging.
So, (Further assumption: add this to last note) assuming you've read a thousand walkthroughs and fucked em all up a few times - you should know the lingo
by now. If you don't and this is all Greek to you ... go try again somewhere else

1 - Get your Stock Firmware. I have it linked for MY MODEL in the README. Its a SM-T772U Galaxy A7 Lite LTE sold in Canada by KooDoo. 
If you're a yank or only hae WiFi, bugger off. You'll find no solace here!
It should look like this:
![Samsung Galaxy A7 Lite-20241004054013309](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e8b4248-9a78-4907-abfb-bd7bd6a35aab)

2 - Unpack it into its constituent parts. Create a copy of those as you may need ot reuse em a few times! This is your base!

3 - Fire up ODIN. Specificially this version:
[Odin3 v3.13.1_3B_PatcheD.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17442805/Odin3.v3.13.1_3B_PatcheD.zip)


take a break. get some sleep. fucking spazz!
